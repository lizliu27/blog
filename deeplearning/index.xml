Each project presented unique challenges and opportunities for learning, covering various aspects of neural network architecture, training pipelines, and optimization techniques.
Project 1: Training Neural Networks for MNIST Recognition The first project focused on building a simple pipeline for training neural networks to recognize hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset.</description></item></channel></rss>
