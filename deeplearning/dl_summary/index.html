The pipeline implementation encompassed two neural network architectures, each equipped with functionalities to load data, train, and optimize the models.</p><h3 id=neural-network-architectures>Neural Network Architectures</h3><p>Two distinct neural network architectures were implemented from scratch for this project:</p><ol><li><strong>Simple Softmax Regression</strong>: Composed of a fully-connected layer followed by a ReLU activation.</li><li><strong>Two-Layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)</strong>: Composed of two fully-connected layers with a Sigmoid activation in between. Note that the MLP model utilizes biases.</li></ol><h3 id=activation-functions>Activation Functions</h3><p>Two activation functions were used in this project:</p><ol><li><strong>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)</strong>: Used in the simple softmax regression.</li><li><strong>Sigmoid</strong>: Used in the two-layer MLP.</li></ol><h3 id=training-processes>Training Processes</h3><p>The training processes for the simple softmax regression and the two-layer MLP were implemented in this section.
An vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer was implemented.
In my experiment, adjustments were made to optimize the training process. The number of epochs was limited, the learning rate increased, and the batch size reduced. These changes improved accuracy and minimized loss, aligning with the expectation that more epochs enhance model learning and accuracy.

They are determined by computing gradients with respect to input pixels, where high gradient magnitudes indicate strong impact on the model&rsquo;s output. Saliency maps are suitable for general interpretability and providing quick overviews of attention regions.</p><p>On the other hand, GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is designed for class-specific localization information. It highlights regions highly relevant to a specific class by combining information from multiple layers and inspecting gradients of output class scores with respect to intermediate layers. GradCAM is particularly valuable for understanding why the model made certain predictions, especially in object detection tasks. However, it requires access to model layers and is more involved to implement.</p><p>In practice, both methods have strengths and can be used in combination. Saliency maps provide quick insights into overall attention regions, while GradCAM offers detailed class-specific localization information for a deeper understanding of model decisions.</p><p><img src=/blog/images/gradcam.jpg alt=gradcam></p><h3 id=style-transfer>Style Transfer:</h3><ul><li>Implementing content loss, style loss, and total variation loss functions for style transfer using convolutional neural networks.</li><li>Stringing together loss functions and update rules to perform style transfer from a style image to a content image.</li><li>Applying style transfer to generate stylized images by combining the content of one image with the style of another.
