Each project presented unique challenges and opportunities for learning, covering various aspects of neural network architecture, training pipelines, and optimization techniques.
Project 1: Training Neural Networks for MNIST Recognition The first project focused on building a simple pipeline for training neural networks to recognize hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning for Trading Project3</title><link>https://lizliu27.github.io/blog/machinelearning/ml4t_summary/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 14:22:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lizliu27.github.io/blog/machinelearning/ml4t_summary/</guid><description>CART models are widely used in machine learning dealing with non-linear relationships and making predictions. To further understand which model is appropriate and the performance of models under different parameters, a series of experiments was performed. For this experiment, the main dataset was currency exchange data collected by Istanbul currency exchange. The 3 experiments were focused on overfitting, the use of bagging and the performance of classic decision tree vs random decision tree.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://lizliu27.github.io/blog/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lizliu27.github.io/blog/about/</guid><description>Hugo, the world's fastest framework for building websites</description></item></channel></rss>
