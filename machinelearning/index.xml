To further understand which model is appropriate and the performance of models under different parameters, a series of experiments was performed. For this experiment, the main dataset was currency exchange data collected by Istanbul currency exchange. The 3 experiments were focused on overfitting, the use of bagging and the performance of classic decision tree vs random decision tree.</description></item></channel></rss>
